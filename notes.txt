TODO:

add: check-macro-has-description: Check the macro has description.
check-macro-arguments-have-desc: Check the macro arguments have description.
add macro desc, adjust exclude pattern for macro hooks!
--> but also in general: e.g. model checks only for models!

prettier pre-commit and cicd


re-activate dbt hooks!
--> seems to be the only way: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75560681/how-to-exclude-multiple-directories-in-pre-commit
Simplify pattern:

1. Only files in dbt_analytics
2. Only files in subfolders:
	- analyses (only some hooks)
	- macros
	- models
	- seeds
	- snapshots
	- tests
3. Exclude CSV files

--> Then try to commit all file types: sql, yaml, md
--> All dbt types (meaning also unit tests)



github action should have a pretty name
check what else can be automated :)
make pythonpath var "better"
make sql update db env aware!

dbt-slim-ci!

create dev branch & work on that

static website hosting in s3 for dbt docu?
--> ionos subdomain!


for dbt cloud only postgres and bigquery possible!

cicd:
dbt_project_evaluator
https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-






- build dim & fact models
- check some BI tool
- check dbt cloud
- check github actions
- check github branching
- check how this project would work with BigQuery
- check best practives for dockerfile
- check if we set requirements the right way
- check scheduling
- cli script to build dbt project (or Python? maybe a class?)

green blue deployment


out of scope:
- sqlfluff should lint dbt tests properly
- python formatters (no need for ruff, pylint is fine)
(add more data e.g. product info, web traffic, customer whatever, channel costs)
