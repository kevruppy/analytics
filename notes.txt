TODO:

pre-commit: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-
--> check models has all cols not working (same for sourc)
--> count of tests not working (mods+sources)
--> script has no tbl name not working

--> dbt parse not working:
can be fixed using custom pre-commit hook:
bash -c "export DB_PATH='/workspaces/analytics/analytics.duckdb' && source /workspaces/analytics/.venv/bin/activate && cd /workspaces/analytics/dbt_analytics && dbt parse --project-dir /workspaces/analytics/dbt_analytics

--> write a little bash script for that


next step is cicd to motherduck!








static website hosting in s3 for dbt docu?
--> ionos subdomain!


for dbt cloud only postgres and bigquery possible!

cicd:
dbt_project_evaluator
https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-






- build dim & fact models
- check some BI tool
- check dbt cloud
- check github actions
- check github branching
- check how this project would work with BigQuery
- check best practives for dockerfile
- check if we set requirements the right way
- check scheduling
- cli script to build dbt project (or Python? maybe a class?)

green blue deployment


out of scope:
- sqlfluff should lint dbt tests properly
- python formatters (no need for ruff, pylint is fine)
(add more data e.g. product info, web traffic, customer whatever, channel costs)
